I'm Artur, a recent First Class Honours **MSci Natural Sciences graduate** from [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk), currently based in London. My main interests include environmental research, species conservation, applied ecology, global change and computational methods. I am now seeking a new role in which I can utilise my interdisciplinary background, attention to detail and analytical skills to tackle environmental challenges and foster positive change.

## Recent projects

Between September 2022 and May 2023, I was conducting my Master's research project titled **"*Potential decline in the distribution of the agricultural pest Nezara viridula in the macadamia-growing region of South Africa".*** I utilised Species Distribution Models and Bayesian networks to predict the future distribution of an agricultural pest in South Africa under climate change. I was working under the supervision of Prof Richard Pearson, and I am currently preparing a manuscript for publication.

In July 2023, I presented the project during the poster session at the **BES Macroecology 2023** conference in Birmingham, and had an opportunity to learn from other scientists presenting their research.
