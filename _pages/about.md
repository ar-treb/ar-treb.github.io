I'm Artur, a recent First Class Honours **MSci Natural Sciences graduate** from [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk), currently based in London. My main interests include environmental research, species conservation, science communication, global change and computational methods. I am now seeking a new role in which I can utilise my interdisciplinary background, attention to detail and analytical skills to tackle environmental challenges and foster positive change.


# Recent activities
## Master's project at UCL CBER

Between September 2022 and May 2023, I was conducting my Master's research project titled **"*Potential decline in the distribution of the agricultural pest Nezara viridula in the macadamia-growing region of South Africa".*** I utilised Species Distribution Models and Bayesian networks to predict the future distribution of an agricultural pest in South Africa under climate change. I was working under the supervision of Prof Richard Pearson, and I am currently preparing a manuscript for publication.

In July 2023, I presented the project during the poster session at the **BES Macroecology 2023** conference in Birmingham, and had an opportunity to learn from other scientists presenting their research. The poster is available to be viewed [here](https://ar-treb.github.io/projects/1.MSci_Poster/).

## Meta-meta-analysis research placement at London NHM
Last summer I was interning at London Natural History Museum as a part of the [SSCP DTP REP](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/grantham/education/science-and-solutions-for-a-changing-planet-dtp/studentship-opportunities/). Under the supervision of Prof Andy Purvis, I was researching the impacts of organic agriculture on biodiversity using novel meta-analytic methods. I was a member of an amazing Biodiversity Futures Lab, and had an opportunity to also contribute to a science communication project, which you can see below.

## UCL Science Communication for Biologists Student Conference

In January 2023 I participated in a student-led science communication conference at ZSL Institute of Zoology. I presented the topic of "The Uncertain Future of Antarcticaâ€™s Biodiversity" and I discussed the power and limitations of new technologies in studying Antarctica's biodiversity.
The slides from my talk are available [here](https://ar-treb.github.io/projects/Antarctica/).
