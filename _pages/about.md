I'm Artur, a recent MSci Natural Sciences graduate from [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk), currently based in London. My main interests include environmental research, applied ecology, global change and computational methods. I am now seeking a new role in which I can utilise my interdisciplinary background, attention to detail and analytical skills to tackle environmental challenges and foster positive change.
