I'm Artur, a computational ecologist and data analyst based in London. I am currently working at Natural History Museum, and previously I spent time in Kew Gardens and UCL. My main interests include environmental research, species conservation, global change and computational methods. 

## Current role: Research Assistant at London NHM

As a research assistant in the Biodiversity & Health research group, I investigate the impacts of global change on epidemiology of zoonotic diseases. I am developing a LLM-powered [LangGraph](https://www.langchain.com/langgraph)-based application allowing manipulating, querying and analysing epidemiological data and studies through a natural language interface. I also help with preparation of manuscripts for publications and development of scientific output across the research group. 

## Recent activities

## Data Curator at RBG, Kew (Oct 2023 - Apr 2024)

I spent 6 months at Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew where I was working as a Data Curator. I contributed to the **"*NutriDiv"*** project led by Dr Samuel Pironon, mainly focusing on collecting and standardizing plant nutrition data from Food Composition Databases. My input provides a base for ML modelling pipeline aiming to predict nutrition across global diversity of edible plants.

## Master's project at UCL CBER

Between September 2022 and May 2023, I was conducting my Master's research project titled **"*Potential decline in the distribution of the agricultural pest Nezara viridula in the macadamia-growing region of South Africa".*** I utilised Species Distribution Models and Bayesian networks to predict the future distribution of an agricultural pest in South Africa under climate change. I was working under the supervision of Prof Richard Pearson, and I am currently preparing a manuscript for publication.

In July 2023, I presented the project during the poster session at the **BES Macroecology 2023** conference in Birmingham, and had an opportunity to learn from other scientists presenting their research. The poster is available to be viewed [here](https://ar-treb.github.io/projects/1.MSci_Poster/).

## Meta-meta-analysis research placement at London NHM
Last summer I was interning at London Natural History Museum as a part of the [SSCP DTP REP](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/grantham/education/science-and-solutions-for-a-changing-planet-dtp/studentship-opportunities/). Under the supervision of Prof Andy Purvis, I was researching the impacts of organic agriculture on biodiversity using novel meta-analytic methods. I was a member of an amazing Biodiversity Futures Lab, and had an opportunity to also contribute to a science communication project, which you can see below.

## UCL Science Communication for Biologists Student Conference

In January 2023 I participated in a student-led science communication conference at ZSL Institute of Zoology. I presented the topic of "The Uncertain Future of Antarcticaâ€™s Biodiversity" and I discussed the power and limitations of new technologies in studying Antarctica's biodiversity.
The slides from my talk are available [here](https://ar-treb.github.io/projects/Antarctica/).
